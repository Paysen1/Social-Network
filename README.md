# Social-Network

This challenge was very good for me for a couple of reasons.  The first reason being I was struggling a lot with MVC and how everything working with that and with this I took my time and really got a better grasp on how that works. Secondly MongoDB was a bit dounting at first but after looking back on past activities it was a lot easier to set up. Overall a good learning experience that helped me get a leg up on NoSQl and MVC.
